excitertools
------------

``itertools`` reimagined as a `fluent interface <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface>`_.

    In software engineering, a fluent interface is an object-oriented API whose design
    relies extensively on method chaining. Its goal is to increase code legibility by
    creating a domain-specific language (DSL). The term was coined in 2005 by Eric
    Evans and Martin Fowler.

    `*Wikipedia - Fluent Interface* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface>`_

Note that nearly all of the ``more-itertools`` extension library is included.
